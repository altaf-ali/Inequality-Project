Load the grids dataset

```{r}
grids <- readRDS("~/Dropbox/wombat/outputData/grids/grids.rds")
head(grids)
```

Subset by country

```{r}
country = "AFG"

grid_subset <- grids %>%
  filter(gwc == country) 
```

Calculate group means

```{r}
group_means <- grid_subset %>%
  filter(!is.na(population_density)) %>%
  group_by(group, year) %>%
  summarize(nightlight_mean = weighted.mean(nightlight, population_density, na.rm = TRUE))

head(group_means)
```

Plot the results

```{r}
ggplot(group_means, aes(year, nightlight_mean, color=group)) +
  geom_line()
```
