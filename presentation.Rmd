Nighlight Data:

- Coverage from 1992 to 2013
- Based on satellite composites from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
- Resolution: 30 arc second grids (with 1 arc second roughly equivalent to 31 meters or 100 feet of ground distance.) 
- Resample the nightlight data to match the resolution of population grids from GPW (Gridded Population of the World) 
  at 2.5 arc second or approximately 5km.
- Nighlight Mean for population groups weighted by grid population density.
- Grids with overlapping population groups dropped from analysis.
